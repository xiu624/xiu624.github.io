        <p>We love music, and our definition of music is quite extensive. Whether it is classical or folk, oriental or occidental, we want to interpret it in a new way.
        Our goal is to spread the culture of music, so that more people could get to know and appreciate a new sort of music.</p>
        <p>At Prims, there is no complex concept or fancy melody, we are just a group of happy musicians with our joyful music.</p>
