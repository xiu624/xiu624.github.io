"Sai Ma" is a solo music piece wrote by [*Huang Haihuai*](#huanghaihuai) for the Chinese traditional instrument "Er Hu".
Music starts in a neighing sound of horse, rough and unrestrained. Then through the special performing techniques like: quick bow, bow jumping and tremolo,
the spectacular scene of herdsmen celebrating the grand race in grasslands of Inner Mongolia has been vividly demonstrated.

Our version of "Sai Ma" is a meticulously arranged Trio of "Er Hu", piano and percussion.
"Er Hu" and piano played alternately, along with the percussion "Mu Yu" imitated the clip-clop, make the whole listening experience a lot richer.
