"Sai Ma" is an "Er Hu" solo music piece wrote by [*Huang Haihuai*](#huanghaihuai). 
It describes the scene of horserace in the grasslands of Inner Mongolia.
With "Er Hu" this simple folk instrument, using a variety of performing skills, 
it brings up the spectacular scene of galloping horses bolted among thousands of soldiers on the prairie.
Along with its rhythmic melodies, the mystical grasslands of Inner Mongolia seem to be revealed in front our eyes.

Our version of "Sai Ma" is performed with "Er Hu", Piano and Percussion. It sounds more interesting.

His work developed the traditional "Er Hu" performing skills while courageously borrowed certain techniques from occidental music.
"Sai Ma" is his representative work, one of the most outstanding work for "Er Hu".
