Dà hán ("大寒") is the last one of 24 solar terms in Chinese traditional calendar. It marks the coldest day in a year.

This [*Hang*](#jiangzhoudagu) solo was filmed under -10˚C in the south of Germany, near the Alps region.

<i class="icon-note icon-inline"></i><b>Hang</b> is a musical instrument constructed from two half-shells of steel sheet forming the shape of a convex lens. The top ("Ding") side has a center 'note' hammered into it and seven or eight 'tone fields' hammered around the center. The bottom ("Gu") is a plain surface that has a rolled hole in the center with a tuned note that can be created when the rim is struck.
