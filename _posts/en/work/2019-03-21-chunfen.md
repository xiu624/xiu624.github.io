Chūn fēn ("春分") is one of the 24 solar terms in Chinese traditional calendar. It marks the day when the Sun overheads exactly at the equator.

The audio is recorded separately with [*Kalimba*](#kalimba) and Handpan, then mixed together in post. Filmed during early spring in the south of Germany.

<i class="icon-note icon-inline"></i><b>Kalimba</b> is a musical instrument with ethnic characteristics in Africa. The name is coming from "using the thumb to play". The sound is made by the metal strips in different lengths on the top. The resonance body below is usually made of wood, bamboo, and also metal in modern development.
