"Bavarian Chinese Summer" is a festival from the lovely bavarian town of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietfurt" target="_blank"><em>Dietfurt</em></a>.
It's aimed to show the different charm of the two cultures. Activities include a variety of music programs, 
a mini marathon in the old town and the "Festmeile", where you can taste the different Bavarian and Chinese food.

Prims Studio will participate this year's festival, we will give a live show at the town hall square.
We are looking forward to meet you there.
