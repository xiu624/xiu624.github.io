    s1_title: <h1><em>Pri</em>ma <em>M</em>u<em>s</em>ik is an attitude.</h1>
    s1_content: <h3>Make music and enjoy it.</h3>
        <p>We live music the same way we live our lives. Being fresh and persistent. We make music that people likes, 
        and we enjoy the enormous happiness it brings to us. Our motivation comes from the need of perfectioning our skills,
        comes from the desire of realising our dream, but most importantly it comes from the pleasure of creating and sharing music pieces together.</p>
        <p>At Prims, there is no complex concept or fancy melody, we are just a group of happy musicians with our joyful music.</p>
        <h3>Good music is a quality.</h3>
        <p>Good music is never made by coincidence. Sometimes we repeat a rhythm over and over again to make it right, 
        sometimes we debate simply because of disagreement on a pitch, sometimes we think really hard to find a unique sound.
        We try our best to create music pieces full of vitality, that can influence people.</p>
        <p>Rigorous, is the key of our creativity at Prims.</p>
        <h3>Music is inheritance of life.</h3>
        <p>Music is everywhere in our lives. The rhythm of car's turn signals, the sound of newspapers in cafeteria,
        and the knocking bell on square. We are all part of the music, we are all players of this "city symphony".</p>
        <p>Music is abstract, but can easily resonate with hearts. It is not as straightforward as text, and not as specific as image.
        It is like a gem-blue stream, gently flowing into our hearts, gives us comfort. Or a bright nightlight, illuminate our way back home.</p>
        <p>At Prims, we are committed to spread the culture and heritage of music because we do care about them.</p>
    s2_title: <h1>Our music</h1>
    s2_content: <p>At the beginning that we founded Prims, we didn't have very clear objectives, nor attach to any fixed music style. 
        We just want to make something "different". Our musicians all have different experiences, different cultural backgrounds.
        This happens to be a unique asset for us. We had the opportunity to mix our ideas, inspire from each other and find our own style.
        We do not want to define our music, nor want to exclude any existing music style, so "mixing" has become the core of our works.</p>
        <p>We have professional backgrounds in occidental music, and ethnic feelings in oriental culture. With this advantage we start to tryout some of our ideas.
        For example, use occidental instruments in "Mo Li Hua (Jasmine)", <a href="/work/001-saima"><em>"Sai Ma (Horserace)"</em></a> and other traditional Chinese music pieces, 
        and add oriental feelings into well known western favorites like "Libertango" and "Tico Tico". Works mixing of Chinese and occidental music styles are naturally born.
        Of course, this is just a beginning. We are constantly updating and refreshing our ideas, and will bring more works of this type to the public.</p>
        <p>Actually "mixing" is not new. In China, more and more composers use occidental elements in their works.
        Such as the famous composer and conductor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tan_Dun" target="_blank"><em>Tan Dun</em></a>,
        professor and composition director of the Chinese Central Conservatory of Music <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye_Xiaogang" target="_blank"><em>Ye Xiaogang</em></a>.
        Their works have the characteristics of both occidental and oriental music, and are coupled with modern interpretation techniques,
        which bring their unique melody and charm to the public. To some extent, they inspired us a lot, and encouraged us to continue making good music.</p>
    s3_title: <h1>Munich city</h1>
    s3_content: <p>For a professional musician, cities like Vienna, Paris, New York, Munich, London, Moscow etc. have a very special meaning.</p>
        <p>Munich, next to Mozart's hometown Salzburg, has an important place in the classical music world. In such a diverse city, 
        whether classical, modern, jazz or folk music, they are staged every day. We have the world-famous Munich Philharmonic, 
        Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, and the Bavarian State Opera. Every year the Summer Opera Festival will be held here in Munich. 
        In just 35 days, around 20 different operas are staged, and they attract thousands of music lovers from around the world. 
        In Munich, every street, church or castle, resonate with all kind of melodies. Music is a important part of the everyday life in Munich.</p>
        <p>Because Munich is so diverse and inclusive, we have chosen to set up Prims Studio here. 
        We believe we will encounter more peoples like us who love music. Together, we could build a world of our own.</p>
